# torii-test

A reproduction of a bug.`this.authenticatedRoute` from `torii` works in Ember 3.5 and fails in Ember > 3.6

Run tests or open the app and go to `/authenticated` (you should be redirected to `/login` but on 3.6 and higher that does not happen).

`ember try:each` will run 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7. I also ran the 3.6 betas (they are commented out in the config) -- it fails all the way back to the first beta of 3.6.
